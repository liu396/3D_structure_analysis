# CS653 Bicontinuous Structure Based on Leveled Field Method and Geometric Measurement

The Code aim to have two features. The first one is to generate periodic or non periodic bicontinuous atomistic sample in arbitary parallelpiped. The second aim is to measure the geometric characteristic value, especially the ligament size. The measurement of ligament size is based on the strategy of Aquami, but in 3D. Domain decomposition and parallel computing are used to accelerate the computation.
