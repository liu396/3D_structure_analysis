# CS653 Bicontinuous Structure Based on Leveled Field Method and Geometric Measurement
## **Aims** ##
This project aims to generate periodic or non periodic bicontinuous atomistic sample in arbitary parallelpiped, and to measure the geometric characteristic value, especially the ligament size. 

## **Method** ##
The leveled field method is efficiently realized by using OpenMPI. To determine the ligament size, the multiplication of distance map transformation and skeletonization using 3D digital thinning technique is the key.
